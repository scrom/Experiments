Those afflicted with zombieism are likely to lose control of their normal behaviours however there is hope.<br>If you are able to find and consume a source of antibodies it is possible to develop some level of immunity.<br><br>Furthermore, any carrier of antibodies who is subsequently bitten <i>may</i> transfer them to their attacker.<br>Thus speed is of the essence. In order to pass on immunity and limit the contagion, it is important to rapidly identify patient zero and all who have come into contact with them.<br>Be warned though that this approach is not guaranteed. Ensure you have sufficient food and medical supplies.<br><b>under NO circumstances</b> should you engage in direct combat as you risk working the afflicted into a dangerous frenzy.<br><br>I'm sure you'll never need to know any of this, right?",
